1.  [EXTJS] The AbstractDataView's LoadMask property bool type has been
    changed to bool?. The TreeView's LoadMask property override has been
    removed.

2.  [EXTNET] The RowExpander's "rowexpander" PType (the plugin alias in 
    Javascript)  has been renamed to "netrowexpander". The "Ext.ux.RowExpander" 
    InstaceOf (the name of JavaScript class) has been renamed to 
    "Ext.net.RowExpander". This breaking change is only relevant if you use 
    a RowExpander in JavaScript directly. If you use the server RowExpander 
    class, you don't need to change anything.

3.  [EXTJS] The DesktopStartMenu inherits the Menu class now, not Panel.

4.  [EXTJS] The EnableKeyNav property of CellSelectionModel, RowSelectionModel,
    DataView classes has been removed. Keyboard navigation is a function of the 
    view's navigation model, and is enabled for accessibilty purposes. There is
    a related discussion in the forums with a possible solution.

5.  [EXTJS] The MenuBase's EnableKeyNav property has been removed. Intra-menu 
    key navigation is always enabled.

6.  [EXTNET] The BoxLayoutConfig's Animate and AnimateDuration properties 
    have been removed. These properties are not supported even in Ext.NET 
    v2.x and have been somehow left by mistake. So, they didn't produce any 
    effect anyways and should removed earlier.

7.  [EXTNET] The type of a GridView's StripeRows property has been changed
    to bool? from bool. It should be always rendered to client, because Crisp
    themes change the default value to true.

8.  [EXTNET] The Column's "grid" client side reference has been renamed to
    "gridRef".

9.  [EXTJS] Selecting a GridPanel's row programmatically doesn't focus that
    row and doesn't scroll to that row automatically. Previously, it did. 
    Here is a related discussion in the Ext.NET Community forums.
    http://forums.ext.net/showthread.php?53111

10. [EXTNET] The GridView's StripeRows property has been moved to the 
    TableView class.

11. [EXTNET] The Toolbar's OverFlowChange event has been renamed to
    OverflowChange (lowercase "f").

For [EXTJS] related changes, the Ext JS 5 Upgrade Guide should be reviewed:
http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/whats_new/5.0/extjs_upgrade_guide.html


1.  [EXTJS] Support for Internet Explorer 6 and 7 has been dropped.

2.  [EXTJS] Now there is no possibility to change a Theme 
    without a full page reload. JavaScript files for each theme 
    must be reloaded. Those JavaScript files override properties that 
    cannot be changed on the fly.

3.  [EXTJS] The AbsractComponent's .Margins property has been removed. 
    Please use .Margin or .MarginSpec property.
    The .DefaultMargins property of BoxLayoutConfig, HBoxLayoutConfig, 
    VBoxLayoutConfig, FitLayoutConfig has been removed. 
    Please use a .Defaults inner property of the container 
    itself or the .Margin/.MarginSpec properties of its children.

4.  [EXTJS] The ScriptMode's "Development" option has been removed. 
    Please use "Debug" for development and "Release" for production.

5.  [EXTJS] The TriggerField class has been removed. 
    Please use a regular TextField and its .Triggers property.

6.  [EXTJS] The AbstractComponent's SetDocked() method 
    has been renamed to SetDock().

7.  [EXTJS] The AbstractComponent's DoComponentLayout() method 
    has been removed. Please use UpdateLayout() instead.

8.  [EXTJS] The Model's .IDGen property has been renamed to .Identifier.

9.  [EXTJS] The ModelProxy's Destroy() method has been renamed to Erase().

10. [EXTJS] The Model's .Validations property has been renamed to .Validators.

11. [EXTJS] The ModelProxy's SetDirty() method has been removed. 
    Now the dirty state should not be changed by developer.

12. [EXTJS] The NodeProxy's Destroy() method has been renamed to Erase().

13. [EXTJS] The TreeStore's SetRootNode() method has been renamed to SetRoot().

14. [EXTJS] The AbstractReader's (i.e. in subclasses like JsonReader as well),
    JsonWriter's and MetaConfig's .Root property 
    has been renamed to .RootProperty.

15. [EXTJS] The AbstractReader's .IDProperty has been removed.
    It affects any subclasses like JsonReader. 
    Please use a Model's .IDProperty.

16. [EXTJS] The AbstractWriter's .WriteAllFields default true value 
    has been changed to false. 
    It affects all inheritors - JsonWriter and XmlWriter.

17. [EXTJS] The Layer's .Shim property has been removed. 
    This setting should not be needed anymore.

18. [EXTJS] The Labelable's .ClearCls property has been removed. 
    There is no the clearing div anymore. 
    It means that you can just remove this configuration property.

19. [EXTJS] The TextArea's .Cols and .Rows properties have been removed. 
    Please use CSS or set manually those HTML attributes.

20. [EXTJS] The ColumnBase's .Wrap property has been renamed to .CellWrap.

21. [EXTJS] The BufferedRenderer's .VariableRowHeight property 
    has been removed. Now it is configured for Columns.

22. [EXTJS] The TreeStore's Listeners and DirectEvents:
    Append, BeforeAppend, BeforeCollapse, BeforeExpand, BeforeInsert, 
    BeforeMove, BeforeRemove, Collapse, Expand, Insert, Remove, Sort 
    have been prefixed with "Node": 
    NodeAppend, NodeBeforeAppend, NodeBeforeCollapse, etc.

23. [EXTJS] Now the ColumnBase class inherits the AbstractContainer class, 
    instead of ComponentBase. 
    The .HeaderItems property has been removed. Please use .Items.

24. [EXTJS] The AbstractValidation class has been renamed to Validator. 
    
    Also:
    EmailValidation      => EmailValidator
    ExclusionValidation  => ExclusionValidator
    FormatValidattion    => FormatValidator
    InclusionValidation  => InclusionValidator
    LengthValidation     => LengthValidator
    PresenceValidation   => PresenceValidator
    ValidationCollection => ValidatorCollection

25. [EXTJS] The AbstractStore's Groupers has been renamed to Grouper 
    and the DataSorterCollection type has been changed to DataSorter.

    Here is an explanation from Ext JS team
    http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/whats_new/5.0/extjs_upgrade_guide.html:

    Support for multiple grouping levels was never realized in Ext JS 4 and 
    groupers was really nothing more than extra sorters. This has been 
    replaced by the “grouper” config and the getGroupString method that was 
    previously configured on Store is now configured on the grouper. 
    The internal structures are now much closer to being able to support
    nested groupers and this config will most likely be restored when that 
    functionality is available.

26. [EXTJS] The StoreBase's GuaranteeRange() method has been removed as 
    deprecated. Please use the GetRange() method with options or callback 
    parameters.

27. [EXTJS] The GridFilters feature has became a plugin. 
    Please add it to <Plugins> instead of <Features>.

    The GridFilters's Filters property has been removed. 
    Now filters are configured for Columns. Please use a Column's Filter 
    property. Also no need to set a DataIndex for a Filter. It comes 
    automatically from a Column owning the Filter.

    The internal structure of GridFilters has been changed a lot on the ExtJS
    side. It led to removing of the GridFilter's GetSerialArgs, GetValue, 
    SetValueFunc, ValidateRecord properties. There is no a direct substitution
    for those properties. So, if you cannot get something working that has been
    working with Ext.NET v2, please ask via the Ext.NET forums and we will try
    to help.

    The GridFilter's .MenuItems property has been removed. 
    Please use the .MenuDefaults's Items of the GridFilter.

    The ListFilter's .MenuConfig has been removed. 
    Please use its .MenuDefaults property.

    The NumericFilter has been renamed to NumberFilter. 
    Also, FilterType's Numeric to Number.

    The GridFilters plugin's FilterUpdate and the filters' 
    (StringFilter, ListFilter, etc.) Update event have been removed.  
    Please use the Store's FilterChange event.
    
    The filters' (StringFilter, ListFilter) Activate and Deactivate 
    events don't fire. That is a bug/omission in ExtJS 5:
    https://github.com/extnet/Ext.NET.Pro/issues/544    

    The GridFilters' .UpdateBuffer property has been removed. 
    Please configure it for a Column's Filter.

    The GridFilter's Serialize event has been removed. 
    Now serialization is done on the level of a Store's filters.
    
    The GridFilters' .AutoReload property has been removed. 
    If needed you can prevent reloading by returning false 
    from a Store's BeforeLoad listener.

    The GridFilters' Local property has been removed. 
    Please use a Store's RemoteFilter property: 
    http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/apidocs/#!/api/Ext.data.AbstractStore-cfg-remoteFilter

    The GridFilters' ParamPrefix property has been removed. 
    Please use a proxy's (e.g. AjaxProxy) FilterParam:
    http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/apidocs/#!/api/Ext.data.proxy.Server-cfg-filterParam

    The FilterConditions class: 
    
        - StringFilter's Comparison has been changed from Comparison.Eq 
          to Comparison.Like;
        
        - ListFilter's Comparison has been changed from Comparison.Eq 
          to Comparison.In.

28. [EXTJS] The ButtonBase's .MenuArrow property has been renamed to 
    .ArrowVisible.

29. [EXTNET] The HyperLink class has been renamed to Hyperlink 
    (notice lowercase "l").
    
    The LinkButton class has been renamed to HyperlinkButton 
    (notice lowercase "l").

30. [EXTNET] There is no "parentAutoLoadControl" global variable anymore. 
    If you need it back, please use the Loader's .ParentRef property.

    <Loader Mode="Frame" Url="Child.aspx" ParentRef="parentAutoLoadControl" />

    The .ParentRef property is only applicable with Mode="Frame". 
    If ParentRef is a non-empty string and if the iframe doesn't restrict 
    access, then Ext.NET tries to save a reference to the parent Ext.NET 
    control that loads the iframe as a global variable. For example, setting
    ParentRef="parentExtNetControl" means that inside the iframe page 
    you should be able to access the Ext.NET parent control  by 
    "window.parentExtNetControl" reference. Again only if the iframe doesn't 
    restrict access. If you set ParentRef, you should ensure that the same 
    global variable name is not used inside the iframe. It will be overridden 
    and it is under the developer's responsibility who uses 
    the ParentRef property.

31. [EXTNET] Support for ASP.NET MVC 3 has been removed.

32. [EXTJS] ExtJS 5 introduced a new, high performance, touch-optimized 
    charts package. This brings lots of new capabilities, as well as great 
    performance on tablet devices. The legacy ExtJS 4 charts has been removed 
    in Ext.NET v3.  For details on upgrading to the new Charts, 
    see the Charts Guide.
    http://docs-origin.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/whats_new/5.0/charts_upgrade_guide.html

    While the new charting package has many similarities with the legacy 
    charts, users should expect to find API differences.

    Also we recommend to review the Ext.NET Charts examples:
    http://examples.ext.net/

    As well, some Charts functionality is missing from ExtJS 5 when compared 
    to ExtJS 4. More information is available within the following Issue:
    https://github.com/extnet/Ext.NET.Pro/issues/583

33. [EXTJS] The Draw package has been heavily reworked in ExtJS 5, 
    which has led to breaking changes. 
    
    For example, the DrawComponent has been renamed to DrawContainer. 
    The DrawText class has been removed. A possilbe alternative could be 
    using a DrawContainer with a TextSprite inside.

    Unfortunately, we don't have a thorough guide demonstrating how to upgrade
    to the new Draw API. We suggest to review the ExtJS Draw guide and review 
    the Ext.NET Draw samples in the Examples Explorer.
    http://docs-origin.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/core_concepts/drawing.html
    http://examples3.ext.net

    As well, some Draw functionality is missing from ExtJS 5 when compared 
    to ExtJS 4. More information is available within the following Issue:
    https://github.com/extnet/Ext.NET.Pro/issues/583

34. [EXTNET] The ResourceManager's SeparateUIStyles setting has been removed. 
    If you previously used SeparateUIStyles="false", it is now the behavior 
    by default, i.e. all the UI styles are loaded at once if any UI is used.
    We don't consider SeparateUIStyles="true" (default in Ext.NET v2) 
    is required anymore. If you disagree, please feel free to initiate 
    a discussion on the forums.

35. [EXTJS] Now a TreeStore's .getById() call returns null if pass a root's id 
    and RootVisible is false. It is better to use .getNodeById() to retrieve 
    nodes.

36. [EXTJS] The ModelField's UseNull property has been renamed to AllowNull.

37. [EXTJS] THe GroupTabPanel doesn't work currently. It should be fixed in
    one of the next releases.
